#### [Integration of novel objects into Digital Twin Knowledge Bases (MA Thesis)](https://ai.uni-bremen.de/jobs){:target="_blank"} 
\
In this thesis, the goal is to make a robotic system learn new objects automatically. The system should be able to generate the necessary models required for re-detecting it again and also consult online information sources to automatically acquire knowledge about it.

The focus of the thesis will be two-fold:

- Develop methods to automatically infer the object class of new objects. This will include perceiving it with state of the art sensors, constructing a 3d model of it and then infer the object class from online information sources.
- In the second step the system should also infer factual knowledge about the object from the internet and assert it into a robotic knowledgebase. Such knowledge could for example include the category of this product, typical object properties like its weight or typical location and much more.
